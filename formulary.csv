Administered via local infiltration, epidural block and epidural infusion, or intermittent bolus. 
Avoid rapid administration of large volumes of ropivacaine; use fractional (incremental) 
doses with the lowest effective dose and concentration required to produce the desired 
result. Prior to epidural anesthesia or induction of complete block, a test dose (eg, 3 to 5 
mL) of short-acting local anesthetic with epinephrine should be administered. The On-Q 
infusion pump is used to slowly administer local anesthetics (eg, bupivacaine, lidocaine, 
ropivacaine) to or around surgical wound sites and/or in close proximity to nerves for pre- 
or postoperative regional anesthesia. When infused directly into the shoulder, destruction 
of articular cartilage (chondrolysis) has occurred. On-Q pumps should never be placed 
directly into any joint.

PROTAMINE SULPHATE (Protamine Sulphate®) 
 
P/P: 
Protamine Sulphate 10mg/ml, 5ml 
 
Category: 
Heparin Antagonist 
 
Indications: 
Protamine sulphate is used to counteract the anticoagulant effect of heparin: before 
surgery; after renal dialysis; after open-heart surgery; if excessive bleeding occurs and 
when an overdose has inadvertently been given. 
 
Caution: 
Too rapid administration of protamine sulphate may cause severe hypotension and 
anaphylactoid reactions. Caution should be observed when administering protamine 
sulphate to patients who may be at increased risk of allergic reaction to protamine. These 
patients include those who have previously undergone procedures such as coronary 
angioplasty or cardio-pulmonary by-pass that may include use of protamine, diabetics who 
have been treated with protamine insulin, patients allergic to fish and men who have had a 
vasectomy or are infertile and may have antibodies to protamine. 
 
DI: 
Protamine has been shown to be incompatible with certain antibiotics, including several of 
the cephalosporins and Penicillins 
 
Side effects: 
When used at doses in excess of that required neutralizing the anticoagulant effect of 
heparin, protamine sulphate exerts its own anticoagulant effects, hypotension bradycardia, 
pulmonary and systemic hypertension, flushing, nausea and vomiting, lassitude. 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and fatal anaphylaxis 
 
Dosage:             Dosage:   Protamine Sulfate Injection should be given by very slow intravenous

D/I 
Various agents have been reported to biochemically modulate the anti-  
tumor efficacy or toxicity of fluorouracil. Common drugs include methotrexate,  
metronidazole, leucovorin interferon alpha and allopurinol. Both the efficacy  
and toxicity of 5-fluorouracil may be increased when 5-fluorouracil is used in                       
combination with folinic acid. Side effects may be more pronounced and severe  
diarrhea may occur. Life-threatening diarrheas have been observed if 600  
mg/m2 of fluorouracil (IV bolus once weekly) is given together with folinic acid. 
In combination with other myelosuppressive substances, dosage adjustment is 
necessary. Fluorouracil should be avoided in combination with clozapine due to 
increased risk of agranulocytosis. Increased incidence of cerebral infarction has  
                        
been reported in oropharyngeal cancer patients treated with fluorouracil and 
                        
cisplatin. 
                        
Cimetidine, metronidazole and interferon may increase the plasma level of 5- 
                        
fluorouracil, thereby increasing the toxicity of 5-fluorouracil. 
                        
In patients receiving phenytoin and fluorouracil concomitantly,  
                        
Vaccination with live vaccines should be avoided in immunocompromised  
                        
patients. 
 
 
Dosage 
Colorectal cancer: The commonly used dose range of 5-fluorouracil varies  
                        
from 200 - 600mg/m2 of body surface. The dose also varies depending  
                        
administration as intravenous bolus or as continuous intravenous infusion. 
                        
The dose schedules also vary depending on the chemotherapy regimen, and 5- 
                        
fluorouracil dose could be repeated weekly, bimonthly or monthly. 
                        
The number of cycles varies with the treatment regimens used and also 
                        
depends on the clinical decision based on treatment success and tolerability.

D/I: 
 
A drug interaction study was performed in which irinotecan was 
                         
administered as part of the FOLFIRI regimen with or without Avastin. The 
                         
results demonstrated no significant effect of bevacizumab on the 
                         
pharmacokinetics of irinotecan or its active metabolite SN38. 
                         
In a randomized study in 99 patients with NSCLC, based on limited data, 
                         
there did not appear to be a difference in the mean exposure of either  
                        
carboplatin or paclitaxel when each was administered alone or in combination 
                        
with Avastin. In Study 8, there was no difference in the mean exposure of  
                        
interferon alfa administered in combination with Avastin when compared to   
                        
interferon alfa alone.

CALCIUMFOLINATE,"Calcium folinate Amp 50mg/5ml 5’S 
    
Category: 
Detoxifying agents for antineoplastic treatment 
Indications: 
Calcium folinate is indicated to diminish the toxicity and counteract the action of   
folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate in cytotoxic therapy and overdose in  
adults and children. In cytotoxic therapy, this procedure is commonly known as  
 “Calcium Folinate Rescue” and in combination with 5-fluorouracil in cytotoxic  
therapy. 
Contra-Ind:         Known hypersensitivity to calcium folinate, or to any of the excipients, Pernicious 
                             anaemia or other anaemias due to vitamin B12 deficiency, Pregnancy and lactation. 
 
Side effects:         Gastrointestinal disorders: vomiting and nausea, severe) mucosal toxicity.   
                             diarrhea with higher grades of toxicity, and dehydration. 
   
D/I: 
When calcium folinate is given in conjunction with a folic acid antagonist (e.g.   
  
cotrimoxazole, pyrimethamine) the efficacy of the folic acid antagonist may either be    
                             reduced or completely neutralised. 
                             Calcium folinate may diminish the effect of anti-epileptic substances: phenobarbital, 
                             primidone, phenytoin and succinimides, and may increase the frequency of seizures

                                  reportedly are increased by chronic administration of high doses of phenobarbital. 
                                  Cyclophosphamide treatment, which causes a marked and persistent inhibition of  
                                  cholinesterase activity, potentiates the effect of succinylcholine chloride.

                                  If a patient has been treated with Cyclophosphamide within 10 days of general 
                                  anesthesia, the anesthesiologist should be alerted 
                                 Since Cyclophosphamide has been reported to be more toxic in adrenalectomized  
                                 dogs, adjustment of the doses of both replacement steroids and 
                                 Cyclophosphamide may be necessary for the adrenalectomized 
 
                              
         Dosage:        Treatment of Malignant Diseases 
                       Adults and Children: Oral Cyclophosphamide dosing is usually in the range of 1 to 5 
                              mg/kg/day for both initial and maintenance dosing. 
 
                              Treatment of Nonmalignant Diseases 
                              Biopsy Proven “Minimal Change” Nephrotic Syndrome in Children: An oral dose of 
                              2.5 to 3 mg/kg daily for a period of 60 to 90 days is recommended 
                     
CYTARABINE (Alexan®) 
 
    P/P:                             vial 500mg/10ml 1’S 
 
 Category:                      Cytarabine is cytotoxic Chemotherapuetic agent 
 
Indications:                 Cytarabine Injection in combination with other approved anti-cancer drugs is  
                                       indicated for remission induction in acute non-lymphocytic leukemia of adults  
                                       and pediatric patients. 
 
Contra-Ind:                Cytarabine Injection is contraindicated in those patients who are hypersensitive  
                                     to the drug.  
                                     Use in Pregnancy (Category D): Cytarabine can cause fetal harm when  
                                     administered to a pregnant woman.  Cytarabine causes abnormal cerebellar  
                                     development in the neonatal hamster and is teratogenic to the rat fetus. 
 
 
Side effects:             The main toxic effect of Cytarabine injection is bone marrow suppression with   
                                    leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia.  Less serious toxicity includes   
                                    nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, oral ulceration, and hepatic  
                                    dysfunction. Infectious Complications. A Cytarabine syndrome has been  
                                    described by Castleberry.  It is characterized by fever, myalgia, bone pain,  
                                    occasionally chest pain, maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis and malaise. 
 
 
 
D/I:                        Reversible decreases in steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations and renal   
                                  glycoside excretion were observed in patients receiving beta-acetyldigoxin and 
                                  chemotherapy regimens containing cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone  
                                with or without Cytarabine or procarbazine. Steady-state plasma digitoxin     
                               concentrations did not appear to change.  Therefore, monitoring of plasma digoxin 
                               levels may be indicated in patients receiving similar combination chemotherapy  
                               regimens.  The utilization of digitoxin for such patients may be considered as an  
                              alternative. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Extensive

        D/I:                 
Substances that inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 activity (e.g., protease 
inhibitors such as indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, nelfinavir, 
boceprevir; azole antifungals including ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, 
voriconazole; certain macrolides such as erythromycin, clarithromycin and telithromycin) 
could decrease metabolism and increase imatinib concentrations. 
 
Substances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital, fosphenytoin, primidone or Hypericum 
perforatum, also known as St. John's Wort) may significantly reduce exposure to Glivec, 
potentially increasing the risk of therapeutic failure. 
Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-
fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is 
recommended when administering Glivec with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow 
therapeutic window (e.g., cyclosporine, pimozide, tacrolimus, sirolimus, ergotamine, 
diergotamine, fentanyl, alfentanil, terfenadine, bortezomib, docetaxel and quinidine). Glivec 
may increase plasma concentration of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-
benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, certain HMG-CoA reductase 
inhibitors, i.e., statins, etc.). 
                       
     Dosage:         Posology for CML in adult patients  
The recommended dosage of Glivec is 400 mg/day for adult patients in 
 chronic phase CML. Chronic phase CML is defined when all of the following  
 criteria are met: blasts < 15% in blood and bone marrow, peripheral blood  
 basophils < 20%, platelets > 100 x 109/l. 
The recommended dosage of Glivec is 600 mg/day for adult patients in 
 accelerated phase. Accelerated phase is defined by the presence of any of  
the following: blasts ≥ 15% but < 30% in blood or bone marrow, blasts plus  
promyelocytes ≥ 30% in blood or bone marrow (providing < 30% blasts), 
 peripheral blood basophils ≥ 20%, platelets < 100 x 109/l unrelated to  
therapy. 
The recommended dose of Glivec is 600 mg/day for adult patients in blast  
 crisis. Blast crisis is defined as blasts ≥ 30% in blood or bone marrow or  
extramedullary disease other than hepatosplenomegaly. 
In children 
 
                          Dosing for children should be on the basis of body surface area (mg/m2). The 
                          Dose of 340 mg/m2 daily.

                          oxazaphosphorines cytostatics 
 
 
 Indications:         For the prevention of urothelial toxicity including hemorrhagic cystitis,  
                           microhematuria and macrohematuria in patients treated with ifosfamide 
                           and cyclophosphamide, in doses considered to be urotoxic 
 
Contra-Ind 
Known hypersensitivity to mesna or any of the excipients. 
 
                  
Caution  
Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna have been reported, Mesna is a thiol  
                             compound, Thiol compounds show some similarities in their adverse  
                             reaction profile, including a potential to elicit severe skin reactions 
                             Mesna does not prevent hemorrhagic cystitis in all patients, Mesna  
                             treatment may cause Lab test Interferences. 
                                                      
Side effects:         The most frequently occurring adverse reactions (> 10%) associated with  
                             use of mesna is: headache, infusion site reactions, abdominal pain/colic, 
                             lightheadedness, lethargy/drowsiness, pyrexia, rash, diarrhea, nausea,  
                             flushing, and influenza-like illness 
                             The most severe adverse reactions associated with use of mesna are:  
                             bullous skin reactions, anaphylaxis, and drug rash with eosinophilia and

D/I 
 
The systemic effects of oxazaphosphorines are not affected by mesna. In  
                             clinical trials it was shown that overdoses of mesna did not diminish the 
                             acute toxicity, subacute toxicity, leucocytic activity, and immunosuppressive  
                             efficacy of oxazaphosphorines. Animal studies with ifosfamide and  
                             cyclophosphamide on a variety of tumors have also demonstrated that  
                             mesna does not interfere with their antineoplastic activity 
                             Mesna also does not affect the antineoplastic efficacy of other cytostatics  
                            (e.g. Adriamycin, BCNU, methotrexate, vincristine), nor the therapeutic  
                             effect of other drugs such as digitalis glucosides. 
                             Food does not influence the absorption and urinary elimination of mesna. 
 
                       
     Dosage:           Mesna is given by intravenous injection over 15-30 minutes at 20% of the 
                           simultaneously administered oxazaphosphorine on a weight for weight basis  
                           (w/w). The same dose of mesna is repeated after 4 and 8 hours. The total  
                           dose of mesna is 60% (w/w) of the oxazaphosphorine dose. This is repeated  
                           on each occasion that the cytotoxic agents are used

have myelosuppression prior to starting first course, as evidenced by  
baseline neutrophils <2x109/l and/or platelet count of <100x109l 
have a peripheral sensory neuropathy with functional impairment prior to first  
course. 
have a severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 30  
ml/min). 
 
Caution:  
Oxaliplatin should only be used in specialized departments of oncology, Due to  
limited information on safety in patients with moderately impaired renal  
function,  
administration should only be considered after suitable appraisal of the  
benefit/risk for the patient. Patients with a history of allergic reaction to 
platinum  
compounds should be monitored for allergic symptoms, In case of oxaliplatin 
extravasation, the infusion must be stopped immediately, Neurological toxicity  
of oxaliplatin should be carefully monitored, In cases of abnormal test results  
of liver 
oxaliplatin should be carefully monitored, In cases of abnormal test results of 
liver function or portal hypertension, which does not obviously result from liver  
metastases, very rare cases of drug induced hepatic vascular disorder should  
be considered.

Caution: 
Toxicity may be enhanced in the presence of hepatic insufficiency the use of small 
amounts of vinblastine daily for a long period is not advised. Strict adherence to the 
recommended dosage schedule is very important  
 
Dose:               
Adult patients: It is wise to initiate therapy for adults by administering a  
                     
                         
single intravenous dose of 3.7 mg/m2 of body surface area (bsa). Until a  
 
                        
maximum dose not exceeding 18.5 mg/m2 bsa  
                         
Pediatric Patients:  As a single agent the initial dose of vinblastine was 
                         
reported as 6.5 mg/m2. When vinblastine was used in combination with 
                         
other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of Hodgkin's disease, the 
                         
initial dose was reported as 6 mg/m2. 
                    
                        
Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: A reduction of 50% in the   
                        
dose of vinblastine is recommended for patients having a direct serum  
                        
bilirubin value above 3 mg/100 mL. Since metabolism and excretion are  
                        
primarily hepatic, no modification is recommended for patients with

D/I 
Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with  
                          aminoglycosides, calcitonin or loop diuretics, since these agents may have 
                          an additive effect, resulting in a lower serum calcium level for longer periods 
                          than required. 
 
Caution 
Indicated when Zometa is used with other potentially nephrotoxic  
                          medicinal products. Attention should also be paid to the possibility of  
                          hypomagnesaemia developing during treatment. In multiple myeloma  
                          patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when Zometa is used  
                          in combination with thalidomide. 
 
                         
Caution is advised when Zometa is administered with anti-angiogenic

include giving it with the next scheduled vaccination at 18 months of age or with school 
entry (4-6 years) vaccinations (depending on the provincial/territorial policy), or at any 
intervening age that is practicable. The need for a second dose of mumps and rubella 
vaccine is not established but may benefit (given for convenience as MMR). 
                             A single 0.5 mL dose of the reconstituted vaccine is recommended.

EMOLLIENT AND BARRIER PREPARATIONS 
 
Emollients soothe, smooth and hydrate the skin and are indicated for all dry scaling disorders such as 
ichthyosis. Their effects are brief so they should be applied frequently, even after improvement. 
 
Use of emollients 
Emollients are best applied to moist skin, but they can and should be applied at other times.  
Emollients should be applied liberally and as frequently as possible. Combinations of cream, ointment, bath 
oil and emollient soap will help to provide a maximum effect.  
Emollients should be prescribed in large quantities. In generalised eczema, an adult will require 500g per 
week and a child may require 250g per week.

Intensive use of emollients will reduce the need for topical steroids.  
Education on how to use emollients is essential to maximise re-hydration of the skin. 
The choice of emollient depends on patient acceptability; thus a few emollients may need to be tried 
before the most appropriate one is identified for the individual patient.
